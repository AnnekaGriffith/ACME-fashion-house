# 3. Bypass Repeating Content
Page content which repeats across multiple pages is a challenge for keyboard and screen reader users if there is no way to avoid the content. If a user is forced to tab through the same set of links to reach new content every time a page has loaded in can quickly become a frustrating and fatiguing process.

## Activity
1. Add a skip link to bypass the repeating page navigation located in the header and navigate to the beginning of the "Best Picks 2020" section

## Solution
* A skiplink is added as the first link in the keyboard tab sequence
* The link is hidden using CSS until tabbed to
* The link destination is the **Best Picks 2020** heading which has an ID of `content`
