# Build The Structure of the Page
Each activity is organised in separate folders with the start and finished code showing how it is achieved, the start code is what you will alter.
## Activity
Donâ€™t worry if you get stuck, re-watch the relevant unit and try again. If you need a nudge, checkout the completed example for each unit and compare against your own code. In the completed code a green highlight effect is applied to elements and regions of the page to show additions and alternations.
1. Choose a more descriptive page title as the current title is unclear
2. The HTML has no default language applied. Provide a global language which is applied to the whole page<p>_Hint: the page is written in Australian English_
3. Add a skip link to bypass the repeating page navigation located in the header and navigate to the beginning of the "Best Picks 2020" section
4. Apply as many heading elements as required to text which you think should be a heading
5. Add the navigation landmarks header, footer and main to the HTML
6. Remove the artificial `tabindex` attribute on all the footer elements and observe the before and after effects<p>_Hint: use the keyboard to tab through the content to find which elements receive focus in an order which is different to how they are displayed_
