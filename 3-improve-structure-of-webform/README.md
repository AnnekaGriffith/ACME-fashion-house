# Structuring a Web Form

Each activity is organised in separate folders with the start and finished code showing how it is achieved, the start code is what you will alter.

## Activity

Donâ€™t worry if you get stuck, re-watch the relevant lecture and try again. If you need a nudge, checkout the completed example for each lecture and compare against your own code. 

In the completed code a green highlight effect is applied to elements and regions of the page to show additions and alternations.
