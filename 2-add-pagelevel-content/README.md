# Adding Page Level Content

Each activity is organised in separate folders with the start and finished code showing how it is achieved, the start code is what you will alter.

## Activity

Donâ€™t worry if you get stuck, re-watch the relevant lecture and try again. If you need a nudge, checkout the completed example for each lecture and compare against your own code. 

In the completed code a green highlight effect is applied to elements and regions of the page to show additions and alternations.

1. Identify if the heading colour "Top month Sellers" is an accessible colour when compared against the background
2. Add `ALT` text to images you think require a description and null `ALT` text to images you think should be ignored
3. Apply the `<blockquote>` element to all reviews
4. Create a consistent mouse and keyboard focus effect for the navigation links<p>_Hint: this involves editing the CSS file focus.css_
5. Replace all instances of "Shop Now" with clear link text
6. Use an unordered list element to group related footer links together
