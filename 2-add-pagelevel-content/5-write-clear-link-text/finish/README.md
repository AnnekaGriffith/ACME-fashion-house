# 5. Write Clear Link Text
Links are the core way to navigate between webpages, but creating link text which is understandable can be a challenge. Unless the link text is well written it can be very easy or very hard for a user navigating audibly to understand where the link takes them.

## Activity
1. Replace all instances of "Shop Now" with clear link text

## Solution
* All "Shop Now" links have been altered to have the link destination on the front of the link, followed by "...Shop Now"
```html
<a class="btn btn-link stretched-link text-reset correct" href="#">
  Bags Collection Shop Now <i class="fe fe-arrow-right ml-2"></i>
</a>
```
